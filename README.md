# `HeaderTool`
### Function:
- Reformats ROM names appropriately. 
- Headers ROMs for use with emulators or Flashcarts.
- Checks for bad dumps

This tool does not contain any sensitive data and exists to allow newcomers to immerse themself in the world of emulation and ROMhacking without committing an act of piracy.

Currently there is only the Python script and local files sitting at a hefty `344 KB`. 

The next steps are to introduce accessing the files over a network (or batch download), then a GUI will be constructed. Finally a CPP executable will be made.

This project then may look to working for other consoles than just the NES.
