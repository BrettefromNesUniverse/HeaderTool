# HeaderTool

This is a Windows CLI and Python runtime tool used to header and rename headerless (or poorly headerd) ROMs in bulk.
The tools also support drag and drop, which may be preferred for manual use.

The `x86` binary targets Windows 7, however no tests on Windows 7 devices has been successful and no support is garunteed.
Currently the project requires an internet throughout the retrieval process.
