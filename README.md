# `HeaderTool`
### Function:
- Reformats ROM names appropriately. 
- Headers ROMs for use with emulators or Flashcarts.
- Checks for bad dumps


### Agenda:
 - Support all Mainstream Consoles
 - Function as an executable
 - Allow final GUI with batch instructions


This tool does not contain any sensitive data and exists to allow newcomers to immerse themself in the world of emulation and ROMhacking without committing an act of piracy.

Currently there is only the Python script and it requires the `requests` module to be installed.


### Notices:
 - SNES ROMs do not come in headerless forms.
