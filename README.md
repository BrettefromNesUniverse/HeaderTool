# HeaderTool

Headertool is a Multiplatform ROM headering, error checking and "goodname" renaming tool. Downloadable as a Windows binary for Windows 7 and above, or a Python script for use in a 64bit python environment. This process is entirely legal and works for all sensitive Nintendo ROMs. To get started download either the python script or Windows binary and drag and drop your ROMs/folders onto the programme to begin headering your ROM.
