# `HeaderTool`
Headertool is a project designed to allow anybody to legally apply an ines header to their ROM, typically for everdrive or emulator purposes.
This project does not contain any sensitive media and serves to safely allow newcomers into the modern retro gaming experience to enjoy their games
to the fullest possible without commiting any act of unwanted piracy.

### Current Ability:
 - Renamed and headers ROMs with python script

### Agenda:
 - use only built-in modules
 - have functioning exe
 - have GUI and bulk download

Note that not all ROMs need headers. Some consoles actually intend for their ROMs to have headers and were created by the developer for functionality.
However, this is not the case for all consoles like the NES. However, most emulators will be able to play NROM games without a header.
Or Mesen, relies on a database.
